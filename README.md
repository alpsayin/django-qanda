### A Q&amp;A app for Django

This Q&A application for django has been developed since there was no totally pluggable Q&A application for existing projects.
This still is a work in progress but it works pretty good now. Be aware that this application was developed with django-1.4, and I don't know whether if it works with Django-1.5 or not.

A working demo can be found in http://inforigo.com/forum

### Features

- Favorite questions (stars)
- Question tagging with hashtags (django-taggit)
- Multiple answers and comments
- Question and answer voting
- Question and/or subscription (django-notify)
- Question categorization
- User profiling (statistics)
- Ready to use bootstrap templates
- Haystack search (needs solr)
- Tastypie REST API

### Todo

- Add a setup script
- Django 1.5 compatibility
